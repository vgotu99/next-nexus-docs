# Common Features

An overview of essential features that apply across both data reads and writes.

## Interceptors

Register request and response interceptors to apply custom logic to all `nexus` calls, such as adding auth headers or logging.

**See also**: [Interceptors](/en/api/interceptors)

## Error Model

Use the `isNexusError` type guard to reliably handle errors from `nexus` calls.

```ts path=null start=null
import { isNexusError } from "next-nexus/errors";

try {
  await nexus(def);
} catch (e) {
  if (isNexusError(e)) {
    console.error(e.code, e.response?.status);
  }
}
```

**See also**: [Error Handling](/en/api/errors)

## Cached Response Headers

You can define specific, safe-to-cache response headers to be included with the cached data. This is useful for metadata like pagination totals (`x-total-count`) or rate-limit information.

**See also**: [Definitions](/en/api/definitions)

## Debugging

Enable development logs by setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXUS_DEBUG=true` in your `.env.local` file. This will print detailed request and cache events to the console.
