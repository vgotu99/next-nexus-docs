# Debugging and Troubleshooting

next-nexus includes a verbose logging system to help you understand its behavior during development.

## Enabling Debug Logs

To enable detailed logs, add the following variable to your `.env.local` file:

```bash path=null start=null
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXUS_DEBUG=true
```

With this flag, next-nexus will print information about requests, cache interactions, and hydration to your browser's developer console.

## Understanding Log Events

#### Request Events
- **`START`**: A request has started.
- **`SUCCESS`**: A request finished successfully.
- **`ERROR`**: A request failed.
- **`TIMEOUT`**: A request was aborted due to a timeout.

#### Cache Events
- **`HIT`**: A fresh entry was found in the client cache.
- **`HIT-STALE`**: A stale entry was found in the client cache.
- **`MISS`**: No entry was found in the client cache.
- **`SET`**: An item was added to the cache.
- **`UPDATE`**: An existing item in the cache was updated.
- **`DELETE`**: An item was removed from the cache.

#### Hydration & Delegation Events
- **`HYDRATE`**: The client cache was hydrated with server-rendered data.
- **`DELEGATE`**: `NexusRenderer` delegated rendering to the client because of a fresh cache entry.
- **`SKIP`**: The server skipped hydrating a key because the client already has the same version (ETag match).
- **`MATCH`**: The server found a matching entry in the client's cache metadata.

## Common Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Hydration is not working
- **Check for the boundary**: Ensure the page or layout is wrapped with `NexusHydrationBoundary` or `withNexusHydrationBoundary`.
- **Check for `NexusRuntime`**: Verify that `<NexusRuntime />` is present in your root layout.
- **Check the `definition`**: The exact same `definition` object (including method, endpoint, tags, etc.) must be used on both the server (for `nexus`) and the client (for `useNexusQuery`). Any discrepancy will result in a cache key mismatch.

### Cached headers are missing
- **Check `cachedHeaders`**: Confirm that the header name you are trying to read on the client is included in the `client.cachedHeaders` array in the `definition`.
