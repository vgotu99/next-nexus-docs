# Debugging & Troubleshooting

Enable detailed logs:

```bash path=null start=null
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXUS_DEBUG=true
```

## Request Events

- START — request started
- SUCCESS — request finished successfully
- ERROR — request failed
- TIMEOUT — request aborted by timeout

## Cache Events

- HIT/HIT-STALE/MISS — client cache lookup results
- SKIP/MATCH — server decided to skip hydration (notModified) or matched a client entry
- SET/UPDATE/DELETE — client cache write operations

## When hydration seems missing

- Ensure the segment applies a hydration boundary (layout) or the page is exported via withNexusHydrationBoundary.
- Verify that the exact same definition (method/endpoint/tags/revalidate/cachedHeaders) is used on both server and client.
- Confirm headers you read on the client are listed in definition.client.cachedHeaders.
