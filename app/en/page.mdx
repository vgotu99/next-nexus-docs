# next-nexus

The intelligent data layer for Next.js â€” automatic caching, seamless hydration, and built-in cost savings.

- Smart caching and hydration across Server/Client
- Rendering delegation via `<NexusSuspense>`
- Tag-based revalidation for server/client caches

See [Getting Started](/en/getting-started) to integrate in minutes.

## Why next-nexus?

`next-nexus` solves common data management challenges in the Next.js App Router:

- **Eliminates UI Flicker & Refetching**: Data fetched on the server is automatically hydrated to the client, preventing duplicate requests and ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Reduces Server Costs & TTFB**: With Rendering Delegation, the server can skip rendering components if the client already has fresh data, leading to faster initial page loads and lower operational costs.
- **Saves Bandwidth**: ETag-based conditional requests prevent re-downloading data that hasn't changed.
- **Simplifies Cache Management**: Precise, tag-based revalidation allows you to invalidate specific data across both server and client caches with a single action.
