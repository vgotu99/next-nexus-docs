description: Reduce TTFB and server work by delegating rendering to the client when cache is fresh.

# Rendering Delegation

Wrap a server component subtree with `<NexusSuspense>` to enable delegation.

## Conditions
- Definition method is GET and includes `client` options.
- The client has a matching cache key and `ttl > 0`.
- Delegation context is enabled for the subtree.

If conditions hold, the server suspends and returns the fallback, letting the client render instantly from its cache.

## Example
```tsx path=null start=null
import { NexusSuspense } from 'next-nexus'
import { ServerComponent } from './ServerComponent'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <NexusSuspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <ServerComponent />
    </NexusSuspense>
  )
}
```

## Caveats
- The delegated subtree must be client-renderable. Avoid direct server-only APIs during render.
- Keep server logic behind server actions or route handlers.
